### Customer Logistics Tribe

Since DH is a large company, it has many different teams that work together to create a wholesome and seamless experience for our end customers. I am part of a tight-knit team of logistics experts called the **“Customer Logistics Tribe”**. We all work together to solve complex problems and deliver the best possible experience to our end customers.

Each member of the Customer Logistics team plays a crucial role in ensuring that our customers receive their orders on time and with the highest level of quality. It is a challenging, fast-paced, and dynamic environment to work in!

To build a successful and enormous delivery platform, from having the food picked up from the restaurants to delivering it at the customers' doorstep, there are various challenges to overcome. Some of these challenges involve defining **delivery areas, configuring restaurants, depicting delivery fees, rider recruitment and management, time predictions, vendor management, order optimization, customer support**, and so on.

### Our Product — Time Estimations Services (TES)

Among the mentioned challenges, there is **Time Predictions i.e. giving time estimations for the orders/deliveries**. This is handled by the Time Predictions Squad through an internal tool called TES (Time Estimation Services)

#### What is TES?

It is a global service for platforms to **retrieve accurate delivery time estimates for displaying to the customer before an order is created**. Its main objective is to ensure that the customer has a realistic expectation of the time at which their order will arrive, called the Promised Delivery Time (PDT).

#### TES Team Structure

**TES** **team** consists of a **product manager, several backend engineers & a test engineer**. Team functions with the support of a **dedicated product designer & a front-end developer**.

#### TES Users

<em>_who are they?_</em>

TES users are **DH employees (internal users)** who uses TES to **add, modify vendor's preparation times, prep time strategy as well as setup default configurations**. Most of the TES users are employees with titles like Vendor Operations Manager, Operations Senior Analyst, Performance Team Lead, Vendor Operation Team Lead.

### Problem Space Explained…

According to a TES survey answered by 50 of our internal TES users, mass uploads is one of the activities that our users perform the most and more frequently. See below:

<ImageGallery
widened
  images={[
    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/TESMainActivitiesPerformedByUsers.png',
      alt: 'Main activities perfomed by users on TES',
      caption: 'Main activities perfomed by users'
    },
    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/MainActivitiesVsFrequency.png',
      alt: 'Main activities w.r.t Frequency on TES',
      caption: 'Main activities w.r.t Frequency'
    },

]}
/>

As per our request sheet from previous quarters & our global survey answered by various TES users from different regions, difficulty in Mass Upload feature was expressed. Since we do not provide proper functionality in TES UI for the users to perform the needed tasks on their own, the TES team had to make several mass uploads in the backend on our users support requests (via JIRA).

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/JIRATicketsComplaints.png',
      alt: 'JIRA Tickets showcasing complaints by local teams',
      caption: 'JIRA Tickets showcasing complaints by TES users (local teams)'
    },

]}
/>

Thus, this functionality in the TES dashboard is cumbersome for users to use. Mass Uploads feature includes many different actions such as changing prep time strategy, updating prep times, editing or removing fixed delivery duration etc

**Problem Statement**

> Our internal users needed a way to be able to perform several bulk upload features for both OD (Own Delivery) & VD (Vendor Delivery) vendors in order to accomplish their tasks through the UI on their own.

### Product Needs

_Considering our business use case_

1.  **Increase intuitiveness** for our internal users & make it easier for them achieve their daily tasks.
2.  **Reducing support tickets & Slack messages** for our Engineering Team, thus reduction of extra work.

### User Needs

_Reducing pains for our users_

1.  Users need to **upload Prep Times, Prep time strategy etc for both OD & VD Vendors in bulk directly through the UI**.
2.  Since **Mass Uploads is one of the most performed activities on TES**, our users should be able to perform it **effortlessly.**

### User Journey

<ImageGallery

    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/TESUserJourney.webp',
      alt: 'Current User flow for our internal users',
      caption: 'Current User flow for our internal users'
    },

]}
/>

**The existing flow had a broken** user experience as well as an **old looking UI**, it had the following problems:

- **Lack of hierarchy & categorisation** of Mass Upload actions (different buttons for similar actions on the main screen)
- **Unstructured** way of providing helpers on the Mass Upload screen
- **Unclarity** regarding CSV template & upload process

### Hypothesis

> If we **restructure Mass Upload feature** and **create possibility of certain actions which are absent in TES UI**, then TES users (including local teams) will be able to do their **tasks effortlessly** through the UI instead of doing work arounds. Thus, their valuable time will not be misspent in creating support tickets ultimately reducing the tickets for the TES team.

### Goal

> **To restructure Mass Upload feature in order to help users perform their tasks in an intuitive way.**

Thus they are able to do the following actions for both OD & VD vendors:

- Mass upload of prep times for VD vendors
- Changing preparation strategy for VD / OD vendors
- Allow to add/remove Fixed Delivery Durations
- Mass upload walk-in times

We would also aim at providing helpers at the required places. As well as redesign the main screen with single option for Mass upload.

### Business Outcome

_Success metrics for this initiative_

1.  **Decrease in no. of support tickets** for our TES team as well as less time spent for our users to create these tickets.
2.  **Increase in Single Ease score (SEQ)** for Mass Uploads.

### Solution Space

_and design process followed by me_

**Creating Wireframes**

After brainstorming some quick ideas, I discussed them with my PM and we selected two standout ideas to present to the TES team:

- **Idea 1** involved implementing a convenient **sidebar navigation** to easily select the type of mass uploads.
- **Idea 2** featured a **step-by-step form with a progress bar**, allowing the user to easily select the type of mass upload action they want to perform.

      alt: 'Mass uploads wirefames Idea 2',
      caption: 'Mass uploads wirefames Idea 2'
    },

]}
/>

**Team Discussions**

As the next step, we held an engaging team discussion to update everyone on our progress in the design process. Together, we conducted a lively brainstorming session to gather everyone's unique perspectives on each idea, and even held a competitive voting session to collect valuable data.

<ImageGallery

      alt: 'Miro Board Team discussion session to know their thoughts',
      caption: 'Miro board team discussion session voting'
    },

]}
/>

As most of the TPS team members were engineers, their focus was naturally on creating solutions that were easy to implement, rather than considering the user's perspective.

**Creating Prototypes for Usability Testing via Maze**

I created quick prototypes for user validation via Maze.

[Maze](https://maze.co/) is an amazing tool for quick usability testing with our users, it has ability to record the user screen as well as video for full overview of what users are doing vs thinking.

<ImageGallery

    {
      src: "/assets/delivery-hero/Idea1SideNavbar.gif",

    },
    {
      src: "/assets/delivery-hero/Idea2StepByStepForm.gif",
      alt: "Mass Uploads Idea 2 with a step by step form",
      caption: "Idea 2 — Step by Step form",
    },
  ]}
/>

To gain valuable insights from a user's perspective, I prepared & conducted a usability test using Maze. **User testing goals included**:

- Obtaining **user feedback, thoughts, and comments on each idea** to help identify the most suitable solution.
- **Measuring the SEQ** (Single Ease score) from our users **on the current Mass Upload feature** (various actions).
- **Gathering valuable analysis for each idea via Maze**.
  As Maze was a faster alternative to conducting 1:1 user interviews, which was ideal considering our project timelines.

    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/MassUploadsCurrentSEQ.png',
      alt: 'Current SEQ Score for Mass Updates Functionality',
      caption: 'Current SEQ score'
    },

]}
/>

Consolidated reasons provided by the users were related to **technical constraints**, **unclarity** & **missing functionalities**.

We took advantage of the insights gained from our SEQ score for the existing Mass Uploads feature and used them to refine our Success Metrics & Goal to achieve in terms of SEQ.

> **Enhance the user experience by increasing the Single Ease score (SEQ) from 7.1/10 to 8/10 for Mass Uploads.**

**User preferences on each Idea:**

      alt: 'User preferences difference between the two Ideas for Mass Uploads Functionality',
      caption: 'User preferences difference between the two Ideas'
    },

]}
/>

Maze test analysis made it clear that users find Idea 2 more intuitive and straightforward, we experienced **an increase of SEQ as well as Confidence ratings:**

      alt: "Ease of Use Score for Idea 2",
      caption: "Confidence Rating — Idea 2",
    },
  ]}
/>

{/* **Finalising the next steps**

As this was a intensive revamp, I suggested my team to break it down into smaller steps of improvements in terms of UI/UX. This approach allowed us to ensure that the existing functionalities under Mass Uploads remained usable for our users and that they could gradually adjust to the new flow.

To break down the design and implementation process, we decided to focus on the **type of Mass Upload action that was most essential for our users and currently missing from the UI — Mass Uploads for Prep Time Strategy.**

<ImageGallery

    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/UsageOfMassUploads.png',
      alt: 'Usage of mass uploads feature',
    },
  ]}
  caption="One of the most used feature of TES"
/>



Thus for phase 1 would have the following tasks:

1.  **Creating a Add widget** for “Prep Time Strategy Mass Update” on the Main screen
2.  **Creating new functionality for updating Prep Time Strategy** with the finalised flow
3.  **Integrating the existing functionality of “Prep times Mass Update” in the new flow**

      caption: 'Phase 1 Out of Scope improvements — User Flow',
    }
  ]}
/> */}

## **Visual Design**

It was time to bring all our efforts together and create an impressive UI design along with a workable prototype.

While finalising the UI design, we encountered some challenges. We needed to confirm certain requirements from our users via slack chat, such as the CSV upload limit for vendors and changes in prep time strategy use cases, to make their experience smoother and more effective.

We went through several feedback cycles for the last step of uploading the CSV file during the UI process. We quickly iterated through the journey to arrive at the final design, which is shown below:

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/MassUploadsFinalVisualDesign.gif',
      alt: 'Final Design prototype',
      caption: 'Final Design prototype',
    },
  ]}
/>


### Improving the Error States

During the visual design, one of the major thing that we focused on was **updating the error states**. When our users upload CSV files, some are not fully aware of how to fill up the CSV templates in a correct order, specially users who are may be new to TES. Thus they incur errors after upload happens.

Alongside, to make the experience seamless & error free, following improvements were focused upon:

**1. Error Prevention**

Which means reduction of errors for our users. We wanted to improve this by providing our users more information around **“How to fill the CSV files”** in a correct order.

The idea was to **update our help documentation and link it to our UI**, see screenshot below.

    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/HelpDocumentationLink.png',
      alt: 'Helper documentation link',

      alt: 'Helper Documentation Snapshot',
    },
  ]}
  caption="Help Documentation link to help users naviagte & use Mass Uploads functionality error-free"
/>

**2. Providing clear error messages**

For all occurring errors, we needed clear messaging in case of successful uploads, and if it fails to upload then informing the users about why in a humane & easy to understand messaging.

This was mainly done by **improving the UI around how the errors** **will be displayed** as well as the **having a clear message & context of the error.**

Alongside also adding **helper tooltips** (whereever required) for users to understand meanings of the terms, specially for new employees working on the tool. Thus making it easier for them to navigate through the TES.

      alt: 'Clear Error Messages for Mass Uploads errors',
    },
  ]}
  caption="Clear Error Messages & helper tooltips in Mass Uploads Flow"
/>


### **Handover & Documentation**

Once the design was finalised, Frontenders were involved more in the process to begin the exciting process of bringing the design to life. I documented upcoming challenges as well as the updates we did later along with the rationale behind, whether it is a team decision due to business impact, team effort or UX decision due to users feedback etc

<ImageGallery

      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/DesignDocumentationForFrontend.png',
      alt: 'Design Specifications and Discussions Documentation with Frontend & Backend',
    },
  ]}
  caption="Design design making documentation shared with the team"
/>

### **Outcome and Conclusion**

After two weeks of the designs being implemented on production, I wanted to collect SEQ from our users using the updated flow of Mass Upload Functionality. To do so, I created a Hotjar survey for the same.

<ImageGallery

  images={[
    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/SEQSurveyViaHotjar.png',
      alt: 'SEQ Survey launched in Mass Uploads production functionality via Hotjar',

      alt: 'SEQ score after functionality implementation',
      caption: 'SEQ score after functionality implementation',
    },
  ]}
/>

Once we got 17 response, was good enough to compare it with our previous score.

>New SEQ score came out to **7.6/10**. Compared to the previous score, it was an **increase of 0.5 🎉**

    {
      src: '/assets/delivery-hero/NewSEQScore.png',
      alt: 'New SEQ Score for updated Mass uploads functionality',
    },
  ]}
/> */}

### **Next Steps**

As the next step I setup tags via Google Analytics to **monitor** and **track the progress of the updated restructure of Mass Uploads**.

## Learnings

This project has been an exciting experience for me. Here are some key learnings from this initiative:

### Familiarising with Maze

- **Maze is an exceptional tool for quickly testing ideas with users**, provided you have a list of users ready to contribute. This tool provides both qualitative and quantitative data for analysis, which greatly aids in final decision making.
- While Maze was a great resource, **I realised that my approach to conducting user interviews was somewhat biased due to testing prototypes in Maze**. Every link is not clickable in a prototype, which users might not know. Thus, some of our analytics were affected for e.g. click rate not being 100% accurate.
- After reviewing the results, I discovered that the **first idea was more challenging for users**, as they were trying to comprehend the task provided to them. By the time they got to the second idea, they already understood the task well. In hindsight, it would have been better to **randomly assign each user an idea** to consider.

### Planning & Execution

- This initiative was lengthy in terms of improvements to be done while keeping the existing features for our users. It took more time than estimated timelines. Thus, **our roadmap estimations could have been more accurate**.

### Absence of Design System in place

- Absence of a design system posed a significant challenge, as there was a lot of back and forth to confirm components with the frontend team.
- We're currently working on addressing this by creating a consistent theme for all internal tools in collaboration with the Design and Frontend squads.

And thats a wrap!!! Thanks a lot for your time… untill next time :)
