Store2be is a Berlin-based startup that enables brands to search & book pop-up & promotional spaces. Their platform enables big brands to find spaces & book them.

# Overview of Existing Product

Store2be has two products catering to two different sets of users.

## User Sets:

- **Big Brands**, interested in booking promotional spaces to connect with their potential customers
- **Space Owners**, willing to rent their spaces out to different brands

## Demand Side Platform — Location Finder

Location Finder is a **search engine** enabling **brands** to discover the right location for their promotion.

## Supply Side Platform — Space Manager

Space Manager is a web app where **space owners** can add multiple spaces with relevant information. Once approved, these spaces appear on the Location Finder.

# Roles & Responsibilities

I joined Store2be as a Freelance Product Designer to perform various multidisciplinary tasks for the Product & Marketing teams.

In the product team, a sprint would last 6-8 weeks. Every sprint, we re-organized ourselves to form groups as shown below:

        }
    ]}
    caption="The teams were divided into 2-3 groups. Each team had 1 Product Designer, 2-3 Developers & 1 Product Manager"
/>

## My Tasks

- Conduct **user research** & usability testing through user interviews and user flows
- Create a shared **design language** and hence, a design system
- Collaborate with product & development teams for **planning & execution** at each step of the **design process**.

# Challenges & Constraints

- Due to the **absence of a design system**, different company departments were using outdated & various styles of design assets. My challenge was to create a shared **design language**, ensuring that the whole company adapts it.
- Since most **users spoke German** & I didn’t, the product manager had to conduct user interviews, with me being a mere observer. My challenge was to understand the users from his perspective instead of mine.

# Problem Statement

> The process of **booking a space** was tedious. The brands had to communicate via email or phone, leading to **regular parley** with Store2be account managers. We wanted to optimize this process & provide real-time updates at each step.

We decided to create a **booking platform** where brands can book a space, check the current status and communicate with their dedicated manager. Thus, **digitalising the booking process**.

# Business Goals

Store2be's vision is to become an end-to-end marketplace where **brands & space owners can engage**.

During my tenure there, we had the following goals:

- Make it easier & faster to book a space.
- Reduce workload on marketing & operation teams.
- Increase the number of bookable spaces on the platform.
- Create a strong brand identity.

# User pain points

- **Location Finder** had a modern interface, whereas the existing **Booking Platform** was outdated. Brands were losing context while switching between new & old interfaces.
- As mentioned above, the booking process was tedious. After shortlisting spaces, brands faced difficulty figuring out the subsequent steps to book it.

**The process to know the current status of a booking is unclear. Clients email/call at each step to check ETAs.**

# Design Sprint — Ideation

Instead of ideating the solutions within the Product team, my product manager & I decided to conduct a short one-day **Design Sprint** before moving forward.

**Design Sprint Process**

## **Process:**

- We came up with **two significant problems** that need attention. Explaining the problem in the form of a story through **User Personas**, we created the **Problem Statement**.
- **Four teams were ideating time-based competing solutions** on paper that they represent at the end of the Design Sprint.
- All the company’s essential members were advised to participate in this, including co-founders, marketing head, customer support employees, product managers, design expert, tech expert, etc.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2560/1*L57_7XVM9ajzVd5ElmNMtw.png)

**Design Sprint Documents**

## **Purpose:**

- This Design Sprint provided all the members with **an opportunity to represent their ideas for each problem**. All the members taking part in the design sprint were employees who dealt with solving these issues daily and the users — providing me an insight on each department’s perspective on the Problem Statements.

## **Conclusion:**

- After a day of sketching, we had four competing solutions on the table. The product manager & I reviewed the solutions & kept the best two as reference.

In the current sprint, there were a few essential screens/UI elements to be improved or introduced:

- **Navbar in the Web-App:** Making it more accessible & practical with introducing switching organizations, my profile, my projects, etc
- **Project Dashboard:** Project view with summary & selected locations in the form of a table
- **Projects Index View:** A “My Projects” screen with all the users’ projects, with the name, dates & appropriate tags — current, closed, ongoing, etc., also an option to create a new one
- **Admin Project Dashboard:** Admins can edit information of the spaces in the project view.

# Project Dashboard

We primarily focused on solving user switching from a new interface while searching for locations to an old interface for booking one.

**Initial User Flow — Location Search & Request Availability**

Looking at the initial user flow, we all believed that the Project Dashboard view was the most crucial screen in the Booking Process.

## **Sketching & Wireframing**

According to Design Sprint solutions, I started compiling a list of essential elements for the Project Dashboard, making sure the users can accomplish the following through the new Dashboard design:

- The user can view his/her **project overview & history at a glance**.
- Providing the user with the list of selected places to book with a **clear view of booking statuses** for each space, e.g., requested, booked, etc. & estimated lead times for booking each space.
- The user has a **dedicated contact person from Store2be** with easy reachability through the app.
- The Project Dashboard contains various **cities as tour stops**, under which the selected locations lie. The Dashboard will also show the **progress of each tour stop** at a glance.
- The user can view **basic info about each space** — amenities, area, price, calendar, availabilities, statuses, etc.
- There should be a **button to add more locations** to the particular project we are inside.

I put together the essential elements and created some initial pen & paper sketches of the Project Dashboard. With the product team’s feedback on my initial sketches, I planned a final sketch to refer to while producing a Wireframe for user interviews with some slight improvements.

## **User Interviews**

For validation, we talked to three of our users. For the sake of privacy concerns, I am sharing the **user personas** and not our real users.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*CGrkSPZLjTvADishogSesA.png)

**_User Personas — with the name, age & occupation_**

We provided our participants with the path of coming to store2be’s website, searching for locations, adding a location to their project, and going on to the Project Dashboard. The insights were valuable. Following the Thematic Analysis approach, **a method of analyzing qualitative data**. I applied it to the interview transcripts. I can divide those into likes & dislikes.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*8Q1yscYIrZyxVj29x3ce2w.gif)

**The prototype used for User Interview**

**Likes:**

- All three users were very impressed to see the overall summary in the form of **data**, like percentages, numbers, etc.
- They had more **clarity on the statuses** of each space.
- The **table format** for displaying the location info seems readily justifiable since the users are used to excel sheets.
- Having a **dedicated contact person** is very thoughtful to keep on the Project Dashboard.

**Dislikes:**

- Users were having difficulty understanding the info for each location due to **missing column headings**.
- There was disturbance due to **too many colors** for status buttons.
- There was **too much text** on the summary. One user suggested having facts instead of sentences.
- The **calendar** on the location row **felt unnecessary** to some users, mainly due to its size.

According to all the feedback, I iterated on the **wireframe of Project Dashboard**, also added some features that we felt were missing:

- **Improved the Locations Table** by introducing the right columns to the location table, replacing facilities icons like water, electricity, wifi, etc., with text, hence **increasing readability.** Also added more information regarding each location, making it easier for the user to compare them.
- Furthermore, **improved the statuses**, making the buttons readable & accessible and statuses as coloured notes instead of displaying them inside the button.
- **Tweaked the content for the Project Summary**, making it more straightforward.
- **Removed the calendar**, as it was a confusing element for the users & we didn’t have enough time to make the calendar element usable.

**Finalized Project Dashboard wireframe in the German language**

# **Visual Design**

For the development to start in the current sprint, our focus was to complete essential screens/UI elements as mentioned above. To do so, I started with converting the wireframe to design.

While restoring the wireframes to designs, we made several minor improvements:

- Putting a **comments column**
- **Removing extra elements from the info columns**
- **Making the status for each booking more transparent than before**

**Project Dashboard** for commencing into the booking of a location was created & implemented into the existing web app.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*rru1nw_Y-anVwxSshDOnFw.png)

**Project User Dashboard design**

We also added several features to the primary project dashboard design. These features were as follows:

## Adding Cities/tour stops inside each project

Adding tour stops through a button “Add a tour stop,” which adds a city in the user project. The selected locations for that city lie inside the relevant tour stop.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*kr4smBuOZejBcrMslXChMA.gif)

**Adding a tour stop GIF**

## Each tour stop/city is in the form of a collapsable accordion

The selected locations come under this element. There is a functionality of changing the order of the locations under the accordion.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*iOOE3hR_VMAZMtRT6oinuQ.gif)

**Collapsable tour stop accordion GIF**

**“Unsorted Locations”** accordion will be created automatically for locations not yet been put in any particular tour stop.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*0bnkdvCbOrFP76-TKSnHLA.png)

**Unsorted locations accordion design**

## A fixed specific booking status column in the Locations Table

The booking status column contained **a colored text UI element** to specify the relevant statuses of each location, along with an **info icon** that clarifies the timelines relating to each location’s booking status.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*DzI04IHL7WaO8251j25GcQ.png)

**The status column in the locations table design**

There are also **action buttons**, which match the booking status for location & lets the user take the appropriate action.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*FP0ze4r2AlGkFpL9sIKH0g.gif)

**Action buttons on the location table GIF**

## Comments Column

We created the **comments features** to provide admin (store2be) and users with accessible communication. It was a limited feature, with the users being only able to view admin/their dedicated account manager’s remarks for something important relating to that location. It was to be advanced in the subsequent phases.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*A_jyRTSwr0HoPKWIAHKJoQ.png)

**Users comment feature design**

We created the same Dashboard for our internal **store2be account managers for Admin purposes**. Admins can **edit/update essential details** relating to locations & their profile and **write comments**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ep_236fGPD-_NAVG8sjVJg.gif)

**Admin users comment feature GIF**

I created design guidelines aligning all UI elements, removing inconsistencies & providing a starting point for **the design system**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3008/1*WRP93cftP8X8ja5I_MizEw.png)

Furthermore, creating a few more consequent screens, one of the most screens was filling the “Request Availabilities” form to request availability for a location.

# **Request Availabilities Form**

After we brought together the Project Dashboard design, it is functional & easy to use. The next important step was for the user to book his/her choice of locations — the first step to do so is to click the “**request availabilities**” button.

We created a **“Request Availabilities Form”** to take in user’s requirements for their preferred space.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*bRtZF6C7mtnO23HwJ1wWOg.gif)

# Process for booking a location

_Finally, we were close to the Booking Process_.

Our Problem Statement’s solution was to create a platform for the users to **book a promotional space following a step-by-step process** with feedback & info provided at each step.

In summary, these were the **four main steps** that needed to be followed by the user to **Book a Location/Space**:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lUVDVuyTIwovhsx_FXByNw.png)

**Steps to book a location on store2be web app**

That means building out the entire booking process online, including users:

- can review prices & availabilities,
- file in missing information,
- request & accept offers, and
- book locations for their promotion.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*HSdnKAYna7wlmtymnnG_nQ.png)

**Booking Process in a nutshell**

Going deep into the user flow, we considered happy/unhappy user paths & retained in mind all facets of products — location finder (big brands), space manager (space owners) & store2be admins (account managers). We came up with the detailed booking process user flow.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*phAGB-iyChgJiHo6qwnK6w.png)

**Detailed Booking Process User Flow**

Once the detailed user flow was united, I started working on the wireframes for the booking process. After all the screens were composed, I created a prototype of the same & tested it among the product team before conducting user interviews.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*a_GIbNuD2WiWqTZn2RY2nQ.gif)

**Booking a location on store2be web app prototype GIF**

The booking process was to be tested later with users, preferably in the next sprint.

# Next Steps

We launched the current sprint design & development completion for our users to use in real-time.

Right after launching the new Location Profiles, we’ve immediately seen many _“Add to Project”_ activities by our users, which was great news.

Simultaneously, as soon as the new Profiles launched, the Market Team started reporting that customers were creating **duplicate projects by going into the Location Finder** and **adding to their selection**, which would always create a new project by default. **They fail to discover how to set an existing project as active.**

**We realized that we missed onboarding the users to the new feature.**

The subsequent vital tasks were to create **high fidelity designs** and fix the issues found yet.

# Results

We created a **Dashboard Project View**, a great start towards building a **booking platform** where brands can book a space, check the current status and communicate with their dedicated manager.

- We received positive remarks from our users of how **their workflow improved** by getting a consolidated view of all the selected locations at one glance — **the Project Dashboard**.
- We could get our new users to trust our product by creating a button for users to **“Request Prices & Availabilities”** for each location. As per our KPIs, the next goal was to work towards 35% of user-created projects with at least one request for availabilities.
- We provided a **pleasant experience** to our existing users while they switch from Location Finder to Project Dashboard.

We will be further testing the booking platform process with our users, tweaking the flow according to the feedback & also regularly going over the data analytics/heatmaps.

# My Learnings

I learned the application of core UX skills, such as user research and iterative design. I thought about the user at each step, following an iterative process & creating/improving features accordingly. Also, Learnt to create a Design System.

Moving forward, I would want to dip my shoes into continuous & required relevant data-driven user research. I plan to be a more proficient user experience designer.

Hope the case study helps in knowing my Design Process better.
